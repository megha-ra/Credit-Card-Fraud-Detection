# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

 ## ABSTRACT
Credit card fraud causes billions in losses yearly. Machine learning can help detect fraud by recognizing patterns linked to fraudulent transactions. This project builds a model trained on past data to identify such transactions.

## Overview

 With the rise in credit card usage, ensuring customer security is crucial. In 2019, 2.8 billion people worldwide used credit cards, with many owning just one card. Credit card fraud in the U.S. increased by 44.7% in 2020, with two main types: identity thieves opening new accounts and using existing ones by stealing card information.These statistics caught my attention as the numbers have increased drastically and rapidly throughout the years, which motivated me to resolve the issue analytically by using different machine learning methods to detect fraudulent credit card transactions within numerous transactions.

## Project goals

The goal is to detect fraudulent transactions accurately, preventing unauthorized charges. The project compares multiple machine learning models, evaluating performance through graphs and metrics while exploring prior research.

## Data Source
The dataset from Kaggle.com includes two days of European credit card transactions from 2013, with 31 attributes and 284,808 rows. Due to privacy, 28 attributes were transformed using PCA, leaving “Time,” “Amount,” and “Class” (1 for fraud, 0 for legitimate transactions).
